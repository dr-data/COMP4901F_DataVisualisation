# COMP4901F_DataVisualisation

## Course Description
This course will introduce visualization techniques for data from everyday life, social media, business, scientific computing, medical imaging, etc. The topics include human visual system and perception, visual design principles, open- source visualization tools and systems, visualization techniques for CT/MRI data, computational fluid dynamics, graphs and networks, time-series data, text and documents, Twitter data, and spatio-temporal data. The labs and the course project will give students hands-on experience to turn their favorite data into beautiful visualizations.

## Project Description
The selected topic is F1 Racing. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017). Using the design concepts for data visualisation, a visualisation has been designed to search, visualise and infer some insights from the patterns found in the dataset.
